      <h2>The Rise of Co-Working Spaces</h2>

        <h6>
            The use of co-working space has increased substantially since the pandemic has altered the way many companies function. There are several reasons for this, but perhaps the biggest is the rise of hybrid working. The data are clear, and surveys done during the pandemic show that workers do not want to return to the office full-time, but in the same breath they also do not want to work from home exclusively either. As a result of the dramatic shift in ways of working, many companies are dealing with the corresponding challenge of re-imagining the workspace.
        </h6>
        <p>Now that employees aren’t working in the office five days a week, space considerations have changed. It doesn’t make much sense to maintain the traditional office layouts when spaces will be vacant multiple days in the week. That means drastically underutilized office real estate and epic waste – until now. Enter co-working spaces.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Utilized-content">
        <h2>Under-Utilized Offices</h2>
        <p>45% of CRE offices are vacant at any given time. Similarly, a Harvard Business Review article written by Nikodem Szumilo and Thomas Wiegelmann emphasizes the tremendous impact that COVID has had on office occupancy. “In New York City, for example, office vacancy rates have risen 11.3% in the last year, and now stand at the highest level in 27 years. That’s true even though New York-based firms such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have been some of the most outspoken about getting workers to return to offices quickly.” Looking at those two staggering statistics gives you a tangible sense as to the logic of why something needs to change when it comes to how offices are being used.</p>

    <div class="Utilized-content">
        <h2>What is a Co-Working Space?</h2>
       <p>So, that leads us to the obvious question, what are co-working spaces? DropDesk, a coworking management software, defines the rise of co-working spaces in the following way: “Generally speaking, the definition of coworking is when people assemble in a neutral space to work independently on different projects, or in groups on the same projects. It’s different than a typical office workspace because the people in a coworking environment generally aren’t working for the same company. Coworking spaces offer the same amenities you would find in a traditional office, along with a lot more. A major differentiator is flexibility since you don’t need to sign a long-term lease in a coworking space.”</p>

        <h2>Coworking Space Real Estate</h2>
        <p>One important question to answer is, what is the impact on CRE when it comes to the rise of co-working spaces?
            JLL, a global commercial real estate services company, has a thoughtful article on this subject written by Andrew Gray, a Director and Equity Advisor of Capital Markets. “Coworking has had a major impact on the performance and utilization of commercial real estate. From a performance standpoint, coworking operators have been responsible for a significant amount of positive net absorption in major metropolitan markets.
            This is understandable as this nascent industry barely existed 10 years ago. The rise of co-working spaces has also created a disproportionate amount of “new” companies that often take space in the same building or general vicinity as the incubator they came from.”
            Gray continues on to say, “Perhaps, the biggest impact on commercial real estate landlords is the reliance on coworking operators to withstand any future economic downturn. Landlords have been making heavy investments, not only into the base building, but also into these coworking spaces themselves. While highly functional and attractive to the end user, these space are often quite different (i.e., denser and more heavily built out) from what a traditional user might require.”</p>
